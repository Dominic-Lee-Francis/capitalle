Capital guessing game.

My plan is to make a daily capital guessing game based on a similar premise to Wordle. Users will receive the name of a country and they must type in the capital. They will have 6 guesses to get the answer correct. A new country will be available every 24 hours.
I will use a PERN stack to make the project.
I would like the app to have the following features:

# 1. Hint System

Implement a hint system to help users guess the capital. After each incorrect answer a different hint will appear. To help guide users to the answer.

# 2. Leaderboard

Create a leaderboard to track users' scores based on the number of correct gusses they make.

# 3. Streaks & Rewards

Rewards users for consecutive days they participate in the challenge.

# 4. Daily Facts.

After the end of the challenge, daily facts about the capital are given to the user.

# 5. Social Sharing

Enable users to share daily challenge score and streak.
